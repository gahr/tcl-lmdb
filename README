This is the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) extension for Tcl 
using the Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA).

UNIX BUILD
==========

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. For more information about the build process, see
the tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the /opt/tcl directory.

	$ cd tcl-lmdb
	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
	$ make
	$ make install
	
If you need setup directory containing tcl configuration (tclConfig.sh),
below is an example:

	$ cd tcl-lmdb
	$ ./configure --with-tcl=/opt/activetcl/lib
	$ make
	$ make install

If your Linux distribution (ex. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSuSE) 
includes LMDB, tcl-lmdb support to use the system shared library for LMDB.

Below is an example:
    $ ./configure --with-system-lmdb=yes


WINDOWS BUILD
=============

The recommended method to build extensions under windows is to use the
Msys + Mingw build process. This provides a Unix-style build while
generating native Windows binaries. Using the Msys + Mingw build tools
means that you can use the same configure script as per the Unix build
to create a Makefile.
